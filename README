Bitlove is a universal podcast proxy for iTunes.

How does/will it work?

  - Subscribe to a Youtube RSS Feed or a .torrent RSS Feed in BitLove
  - Bitlove will download video/audio and cache locally
    - Later: convert audio/video to aac/avc
  - Bitlove then provides these files via http on localhost
    - It might also be possible to add files directly, with feedid intact
      (needs to be invesigated)
  - And automatically subscribes iTunes to the local proxy (if it isn't already)
  - After everything's finished, we growl.
  

IDEAS

  - bitlove:// uri to subscribe in BitLove directly
  - Test for handler to display button? (Does that need a plugin or will it work in JS?)
  - Delete cache after download? Or after time/size?
